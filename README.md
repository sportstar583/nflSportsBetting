# nflSportsBetting

Data pipeline for an NFL betting model, sourced from [nflverse](https://github.com/nflverse) via `nflreadpy`.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/pull_data.py   # writes parquet files to data/raw/ (gitignored, ~110MB)
```

Datasets (seasons 2018–2026): schedules (with spread/total/moneyline), play-by-play, team stats, player stats, injuries, rosters.

## Features and baseline backtest
```
python scripts/features.py   # -> data/features.parquet (rolling 8-game EPA/success/points diffs, rest, weather; no look-ahead)
python scripts/backtest.py   # walk-forward 2022-2025, ridge + GBM vs. closing spread
```
Features also include shrunk career QB EPA/dropback for each starter (`d_qb_epa`, `d_qb_exp`) and counts of Out/Doubtful players by position group (`d_inj_*`). `backtest.py` compares feature sets `base`, `base+qb`, `base+qb+inj`.

Result: the models do not beat the closing line (MAE ~9.57 vs 9.54 for the market), and ATS results at -110 are within noise (break-even is 52.4%). Adding QB and injury features did not help (MAE 9.59 / 9.64 vs 9.57 base): the closing spread already prices in the starter and injuries, so the model is feeding on information the market has absorbed. Treat this as a starting point.

## Totals (over/under) backtest
```
python scripts/backtest_totals.py   # predicts total - total_line, walk-forward 2022-2025
```
Also no edge: MAE 10.25-10.28 vs 10.19 for the closing total, and every edge cutoff with a meaningful sample loses money at -110.

## Run/pass splits and pace
Features now include rolling pass/run EPA (offense and defense), plays per game and pass rate, all computed from play-by-play, so no pace API or key is needed. Spread and totals backtests were re-run with them (`base+splits`, `all`, `line+env+splits+pace`): still no edge (MAE 9.61-9.73 vs 9.54 for spreads, 10.27-10.31 vs 10.19 for totals).

## Opponent-adjusted EPA and tempo (ported from the college repo)
`scripts/adjust.py` fits, walk-forward for every week, a play-weighted ridge regression
(EPA/play = mean + offense + opponent defense + home field) over the prior two years with a
180-day half-life, for all plays, passes and runs; plus decayed seconds per play from drive clock.
Features: `d_adj_*` (net rating gap, spreads), `s_adj_*` (combined expected EPA, totals),
`d_/s_sec_per_play`. Backtest sets `adj`, `adj+qb+inj` (spreads) and `line+env+adj+tempo` (totals).

The adjusted ratings are better ratings (correlation with the closing spread 0.86 vs 0.78 for
raw rolling EPA) but give no betting edge: spread MAE 9.65-9.79 vs 9.54 market, and they
lost at every edge cutoff; totals MAE 10.25-10.29 vs 10.19. Better ratings mostly agree
more with the market.

Also fixed: schedules and injuries use `OAK` for 2018-19 while pbp uses `LV`, which dropped all
32 of those Raiders games from training. Team codes are now normalized.

## Weekly card (top 3 overs + top 3 unders), totals
Same strategy as the college repo's card, printed by `backtest_totals.py` for each model/feature set.
2022-2025: 51.0%-53.0% across the 8 variants (best: GBM line+env, 236-209, +5.5u), no variant
above breakeven in every season. No edge; note an NFL week has ~16 games, so 6 picks is over a
third of the slate, far less selective than the college card.

`python scripts/backtest_totals.py N` sets picks per side (default 3). Top 2 each way: 50.5%-54.9%
(best GBM line+env 168-138, but 50.6% in 2024). Top 1 each way: 49.4%-56.5% on ~160 bets each
(ridge adj+tempo 91-72 is the only variant above breakeven every season). With 24 card variants
tried, the best results are what chance alone would produce; none is significant.
